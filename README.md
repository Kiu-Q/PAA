# PAA
## Project name
“Planting Area Algorithm” (PAA)

## Introduction 
“Planting Area Algorithm” (PAA) is a algorithm that check out if the environment is good for planting, in terms of temperature, humidity, light intensity and soil moisture. It will give out a mark for the environment, in addition provide a correction factor to increase the comfortable level for growing up foods.

## Objective 
Looking forward to the future, food is a important factor for human beings to survive, therefore, a better planting environment is needed for growing foods. However, how can we know is the environment is suitable for growing plants? As a result, I developed this “Planting Area Algorithm” (PAA).

## Background 
But rather than future food problem, I begin this project because I am planting some mint leaves at my home but they are not growing well so that I want to make a algorithm which can help us to find a suitable place for planting.

## Target group
Basically I am glad that all citizens who are planting can use my project.

##　Plan
PAA is easy to use, only two steps are required. First, enter the four needed varible, which are temperature, himidity, light intensity and soil moisture. If the user don't know the information, fill in N/A. Second and the last, the program will give out a mark (0-100) that represent the suitable level of the environment. In mostly cases, upper than 50 is ok for planting, however, if lower than 50, PAA will give out which variable is the worest for planting.
